I'm Austin, and this is my personal website. The topics range while mostly orbiting around natural sciences, my background. I hope you learn, and I hope you think of questions while you read. Questions are evidence of curiosity, a driving force of scientific research. Comments are not enabled on my posts, but if you really want to respond to something, just [contact me](mailto:awprc@pm.me).
