In trying to visualize how some research papers were related, I used LucidCharts auto-arrange feature to create my own network diagram. This shows how the research of one paper fed the research of a later paper. In the core of the diagram is a team of researchers at Cornell (Cela, Ketterings, Soberon). Their research papers are currently feeding mine. I plan on adding more to this diagram over time.
