<p>In R, I plot with <code>ggplot</code>. Inspired by others who have also made themes that look nicer than the default options provided in the package, I present my own theme (at the end).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># package contains ggplot
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>Examples of default plots</p>
<p>I’ll plot the built-in <code>mtcars</code> data, with some added titles and with modifications to the points (colors and shapes).</p>
<p><img src="/post/my-ggplot-theme_files/figure-html/default-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This default plot theme has one glaring issue, in my opinion: the gray background. It reduced contrast and obscures patterns. It can work, but even then it needs an all-gray plot to work, also requiring really dark points to see well. Here are two other default plot themes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># theme_bw
p + theme_bw()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/my-ggplot-theme_files/figure-html/more-defaults-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code># theme_classic
p + theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/my-ggplot-theme_files/figure-html/more-defaults-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The classic choice isn’t bad; has a clean feel that says, “I’m ready for a look”. But making your own theme isn’t that hard, and the results can be more rewarding. Of course, packages like <code>ggthemes</code> and <code>hrbrthemes</code><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> exist, but again, it isn’t that hard to do yourself.</p>

      legend.key.height = unit(x = 5, units = &quot;mm&quot;),
      legend.justification = c(1, 1),
      legend.position = c(1, 1)
    )

<p>I currently like the Roboto Condensed font (used with <code>extrafont</code>). I like using faint lines behind the data, that help interested viewers extract data. I like aligning the axis titles to the top and left. This makes sense as most plots are read left-to-right.</p>
