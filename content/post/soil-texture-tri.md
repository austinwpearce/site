Soils are composed, in part, by small particles of sand, silt, and clay. The specific composition of these helps to determine the texture of a soil. Below are two interactive (click, drag, zoom) scatter plots that represent the fabled soil textural triangle. When your mouse hovers over a point, you'll see an x, y, and z value appear which, on the first plot, represents the percent sand, silt, and clay, respectively, for that particular soil composition.
