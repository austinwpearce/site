title: Honest Titles for Scholarly Works

summary: "Titles can be more direct, succinct, and honest."
---

The titles for many scholarly publications (at least in my field) are not as direct, succinct, or honest as they could be. So many titles are vague and non-descript, giving only partial no hint into the research objective, methods, or results. It's like some titles are just a few keywords strung together so that the paper can be lumped into some field of similar topics. I made that mistake, too, when titling my thesis (first example). Other titles are decent attempts at being precise and making claims, needing just a little polishing. In an effort to improve titles--whether needed or not--I present the following.
