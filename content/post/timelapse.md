[This tool](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/) highlights the importance of having 'eyes in the sky'.

Satellite imagery has the potential to teach us a lot about how our Earth is changing and can provide insight into whether we are a force behind the changes. This tool created by the Carnegie Mellon [CREATE Lab](http://cmucreatelab.org/) is powered by the Google Earth Engine, and it shows timelapse of the entire earth, in high resolution imagery. I've selected fascinating examples of change over time and shared them below.

## Not-So-Great-Anymore Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA

Regarding the Great Salt Lake, another way to show change over time can be found through a similar site called [Global Surface Water Explorer](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/). If you turn on the "Change Intensity" layer, you'll see the areas of the [Great Salt Lake](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/#v=41.2064,-112.27858,7.321,latLng&t=0.00&l=wo) that have significantly decreased in surface water extent.

## Rotating Logging in Western Oregon, USA

Sometimes, viewing change over time can be beautiful and mesmerizing. Try not to get hypnotized by the shifting mosaics of cleared timber sites (below).
