Colorimetry is not a difficult concept to grasp. A four-year-old child understands basic colorimetry. Let's say I make two glasses of red juice for this child using a powdered drink mix. First, I fill both glasses to equal volumes of water. Then, in the first glass I add only one tablespoon of drink mix. In the second glass I add two tablespoons of drink mix. Once mixed, I serve both drinks to the child. The child sips both and rejects the first glass because the juice isn't as sweet as in the second. I guess I should have seen that coming because, after all, I only put one tablespoon of drink mix when the recipe called for two. [Not everyone enjoys drinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwTsZHGQ6FE) made by someone else.

But to say the juice is more sweet or more red in one glass than in the other still leaves a lot of room for error in the judgement of the taster or observer. What if the differences in drink mix concentrations had been only 1 teaspoon instead of one tablespoon? What if the difference had only been 1/8th of a teaspoon?

And what if I wanted to measure the concentration of something like a blue window cleaning solution? I certainly wouldn't want to taste it to figure that out.

This is the essential problem addressed by colorimetry and Beer's Law: how does one quantify even the most subtle of differences in the concentration of two solutions? Answer: with color reactions, light, and an instrument for measuring light.
